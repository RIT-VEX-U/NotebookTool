<h2>Team Goals</h2>
<h3>Win Tournament Champions at Worlds</h3>
<p>Requirements for this goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winning autonomous in a majority of matches
<ul>
<li>Knowing where you are in auto
<ul>
<li>Localization through methods other than drive encoders</li>
<li>Ability to measure movement from sliding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reaching the mobile goals on the line
<ul>
<li>Ability to move quickly</li>
<li>Ability to control Mobile Goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ranking Highly in Qualifications
<ul>
<li>getting the Autonomous Win Point Consistently
<ul>
<li>Consider that there are other robots on the field</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winning Excellence at Worlds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rank within the top 30% in qualifications</li>
<li>Score within the top 30% of programming skills</li>
<li>Score within the top 30% of combined skills</li>
<li>Whole team contributing to the notebook</li>
<li>Thorough testing of designs</li>
<li>Thorough Game Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Last season, our team won Division Finalist and the Innovate Award at Worlds. We want to aim higher this year, but to do that, we need to recognize our shortcomings and identify what we need to do to improve.</p>
<p>There is significant overlap between these two goals. Both are about consistent thorough work before, during, and after matches. A major issue for the team last season was a lack of consistency, both from the game elements themselves and from decisions.</p>
<h3>Areas of Consistency</h3>
<h3>Consistent Mechanisms</h3>
<p>A foundation of consistency in matches is having a robot that works in every match. The elements of this are thorough design for the loads that parts are under and for quick repairability.</p>
<h4>Consistent Programs</h4>
<p>With autonomous being consistently important in matches and in programming skills, having a reliable autonomous is extremely important. Elements where our autonomous programs have been inconsistent in the past have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to account for Autonomous in Design
<ul>
<li>Example: the autonomous program is unable to detect the if robot slides from side to side on its all omni wheel drivetrain. If autonomous was considered measures to prevent or detect sliding could have been implements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to account for edge cases.
<ul>
<li>Example: The vision program detects a person wearing a red shirt outside of the field instead of detecting a red game element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consistent Practices</h4>
<p>To achieve quality in results there needs to be consistency in quality throughout the process at all stages. Particularly with the relatively long time of a VURC season, it is necessary to adhere to high standards for practices the whole time.</p>
<h2>Game Analysis</h2>
<p>From analyzing the characteristics of the game it was found that the maximum score for an alliance is 100 points and the maximum combined score in a match is 161 points.</p>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<h4>Climbing</h4>
<p>This method of getting points is the greatest single source of points of any objective in the game, with the ability to get 24 points. Importantly these points cannot be taken away by the other alliance, unlike rings that can be descored or cancelled by rings in the negative zone.</p>
<h4>Mobile Goals in Positive Zones</h4>
<p>Moving mobile goals into positive zones can cause a significant swing in points in a match. Because only two mobile goals can go into positive zones, any benefit from a positive zone is one that an opponent cannot get.</p>
<h4>Top Rings on Stakes</h4>
<p>Top rings are the most important ring on a stake, getting 3 points compared to the 1 point that a ring normally scores. Especially because of the limited number of scoring locations it is especially important to optimize where rings are on the stakes to get as high of a score as possible.</p>
<h3>Stopping Opponents from Scoring</h3>
<h4>Mobile Goals in Negative Zones</h4>
<p>This is the most direct method of lowering the opposing score. Each ring on a mobile goal in the negative zone effectively takes away an equivalent ring from the opposing score, meaning that at maximum 16 points could be removed from the opposing alliances score. The equivalent of 5 top rings and one ring not on top, or 16 rings not on top.</p>
<p>This reduces the maximum score of the opposing team from 100 points to 46 points. This is from a combination of the 32 point swing from the mobile goals being moved into the negative zone and forcing the other team to place rings in what would normally be suboptimal locations to counteract that.</p>
<h4>Descoring Rings</h4>
<p>Another very direct method of lowering the opposing score. It is legal to remove all rings except for those on the opposing team's alliance wall stake. Descoring rings also gives the opportunity to put your own rings on top.</p>
<h4>Forcing suboptimal Ring placement</h4>
<p>An indirect way of taking away points. Because there are a limited number of both scoring locations and rings on the field, it is most optimal to have two full mobile goals in the positive zone and the rest of the rings spread out on the top of the remaining stakes so the average ring is worth more.</p>
<h4>Slowing opposing team's scoring</h4>
<p>Slowing down opposing scoring, also called defense, is a common element across games. It is likely to be particularly important in this game in the endgame period both to ensure that mobile goals with the team's rings are in the positive zones, and to potentially prevent the other team from performing a high tier buddy climb. Preventing a climb is possible because climb protections only prevent actions while touching the ladder, so legal defense in any other part of the field is allowed.</p>

<h3>Interpretation of Results</h3>
<p>These results show that the team strongly values scoring the the autonomous period. The autonomous period has the potential to be particularly important in this game, both for attaining the autonomous win point to rank higher, as well as the 6 point autonomous bonus. The autonomous bonus could be particularly useful as those points cant be taken away, unlike scored rings.</p>
<p>These results also show a greater focus on placing mobile goals in the positive and negative zones of the field over climbing.</p>
<h2>Goals for Autonomous</h2>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>There are major tradeoffs in how to score in autonomous. There are two main causes of tradeoffs for the autonomous period: getting the autonomous bonus vs. setup for scoring in driver control; and risk of crossing the autonomous line vs. additional scoring benefit.</p>
<p>Examples of the first tradeoff is scoring only the team's rings to get an advantage in score in auto vs. scoring both teams rings to force the opposing team to have rings in suboptimal positions. Another example of this is the decision to climb in autonomous, which could nearly guarantee the autonomous bonus but would take up time in tele-op to get off the ladder.</p>
<p>Examples of the second tradeoff are scoring on neutral stakes, and deciding what mobile goals to grab. Getting into a fight over a mobile goal has a risk of crossing the auto line, but has the benefit of potential additional scoring.</p>
<h2>Goals for Skills</h2>
<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>The big tradeoff in skills is going for blue rings vs. strictly scoring red rings. Blue rings require all red rings to be in scoring positions in order to have a point value, and any red rings above a blue ring on a stack will have no point value. This introduces a risk to attempting to score any blue rings because if we miss or fail to score any red rings throughout the skills run then we could lose out on a significant number of points.</p>
<p>Out of the 33 rings on the field in skills, 11 are blue rings and 24 are red rings. This means that the maximum score while scoring blue rings is 11 points higher in any individual run, or 22 points higher combined. The maximum skills score is 117 points, or 106 points without scoring blue rings</p>

We also receive club dues from team members, but that typically only covers the cost of t-shirts. We also charge event registration fees for our VEX U and VRC events, which usually covers the cost of the additional fields.</p>
<p>This year, our expected budget is around $27,000 based on previous years combined with our expected increases. Most of the expenses come from travel and lodging, specifically for the World Championship since we try to take as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Each year, we have to submit a budget request to the Student Government with our expected budget. Based on previous years' average sponsorships, event registration fees, and clubs dues, we requested around $20,000 from the Student Government.</p>

Another issue with Overleaf is that all photos have to be imported into the document. This means that any photos in Google Docs would have to be saved by one person and imported to Overleaf, which takes up a large amount of time.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Both Google Docs and Overleaf are very flexible. Overleaf allows very precise formatting and easily supports image uploads.</li>

</span></span></code></pre><p>Obsidian is a powerful system for organizing, consulting, and taking notes. It is advertised as a knowledge base of interconnected notes that allows users to keep track of large, non-linear sets of information. The actual written format is a dialect of markdown tailored specifically for Obsidian's needs and the Obsidian app provides a powerful editor that allows seamless editing with a more traditional word processor interface. Additionally, there is a rich, community developed, plug-in system that can fill some of the gaps left by the tool.</p>
<p><img src="Assets/Pasted%20image%2020241016105428.png"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Collaboration is perhaps Obsidian’s greatest weakness. Although members of the community have sought to provide it, the application does not by default support real-time, collaborative editing, and the 3rd party plugins leave much to be desired. However, the Obsidian project is simply a directory of markdown files and can be shared via Google Drive. This provides collaboration on the project level but would not allow two members to work together on a single note without the risk of overwriting the others' work. Idiomatic Obsidian use encourages a large number of short notes so this is not a complete roadblock but great care would have to be taken in the notebooking process to avoid the shortcomings of the tool.</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong>: Markdown is a fairly simple format with which to write. It has a fairly small number of features and Obsidian makes using them very easy. Additionally, there are countless Obsidian tutorials online from which to learn. While the plug-in ecosystem is one of Obsidian's greatest strengths, for some plug-ins, the learning necessary to use them could provide extra barriers of entry that using a more widely used tool such as Google Docs would avoid.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Obsidian markdown is quite powerful compared to standard markdown implementations. However, it is still limited compared to the likes of Google Docs and LaTeX. It is simple to learn but with that simplicity comes a loss of some features. Specifically, this system does not allow for repositioning text and images while writing which could be an issue for the notebook.</li>
<li><strong>Final Output</strong>: By default, Obsidian can export PDFs of a single note content but does not support aggregating an entire project into one PDF. There are unofficial plugins to support this functionality, though. Importantly for the final product, since theming is not a choice left to the writer but rather to the settings of export, the notebook would have consistent formatting throughout. Using CSS, the output of the project can be tailored to best present information for a VEX Notebook without requiring mass edits to the entire document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, <strong>Obsidian is very strong in its usability and the final output</strong>. However, since its usability is so simplistic, some features that would be supported by Google Docs or LaTeX are lost. Additionally, collaboration is not ideal because it does not support real-time edits.</p>

</span></span></code></pre><p>Notion is a text-based editor used by many teams to document their design process. It is used for anything from note-taking or journaling to task management and progress checks to team organization. It is organized by workspaces, databases, and pages. Using Notion for the notebook would have us create a new page for each entry. The pages would all be a part of the same database. While Notion is just a text-based editor, it has a wide range of functionality. It has many formatting options, such as callouts, custom tags, author tags, code blocks, built-in tables and charts, and even slack message integration.</p>
<p><img src="Assets/Pasted%20image%2020241016105557.png"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Notion is very collaborative, using Teamspaces to share documents. This would allow all team members to contribute equally. Notion also supports live updates, meaning that team members can update the same documents simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Usability</strong>: The biggest issue with Notion is setting up a notebook. If set up correctly, it can be very easy to use. However, it has a slight learning curve for set up. Another issue is exporting. Pages can be exported in bulk, but are downloaded as separate files. Since each page is its own entry, there would be many files to combine together at the end rather than exporting as one document.</li>
</ul>
<details data-callout="NOTE" open>
<summary>
Note
</summary>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>While testing Notion, a notebook template was set up, meaning that for this season the set-up drawback is low. In future seasons, this may differ depending on how the notebook is organized.</p>
</div>
</details>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Graphics are supported and can be easily added to pages. Notion also supports built-in charts and tables, making it easy to edit them later on. Template pages can also be created, which would cut down formatting time. Templates could be made for hardware entries, software entries, strategy entries, and steps of the design process. This would tie into usability, though, since it would increase the set-up learning curve.
<ul>
<li>Notion also has numerous small built-in features that can improve the notebook’s organization and readability. These include callouts, code blocks, custom category tags, and author tags.</li>
<li>Another feature that Notion has is databases. If we used Notion for the notebook, each page would be an entry, and the pages would all be a part of the same database. This would allow us to sort pages by filters using category tags, checkboxes, etc. If we implemented this, we could sort by finished/unfinished entries, use template pages, and have different notebook views. This would allow the notebook to be more organized, easy to navigate, and easy for everyone to understand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Final Output</strong>: A Notion notebook would be very easy to follow and readable. The biggest concern with output would be exporting. The process of exporting a Notion notebook has many steps, but is more tedious than high effort. The free plan of Notion does not allow multiple PDFs to be exported at once. Instead, it would have to be exported as multiple HTML files, then converted to PDFs. From there, the PDFs would have to be combined and numbered.
<ul>
<li>One downside to Notion compared to LaTeX is a table of contents. Notion would not have an automated table of contents, as each entry is its own page, so the table of contents would have to be manually written.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another feature that Notion supports is Slack integration. This would allow us to know when new entries are created, easily turn Slack conversations into notebook entries, and stay up-to-date with Notion tasks (e.g. when a task is completed, a notification is sent to Slack).
<ul>
<li>This could resolve the issue of documentation falling short because updates in Slack were not always moved over to the notebook. This would streamline that process as well as facilitate Slack conversations and documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, <strong>Notion would be very good for collaboration and flexibility</strong>. The final output would be nicely formatted and easy to read. The downsides to using Notion would be the initial learning curve, and exporting files.</p>

</span></span></code></pre><p>Since the team is using GitHub Project management tools for team organization, leveraging its issue system could prove useful. This notebooking system would use the comments beneath a GitHub issue to store notebook entries. Each project that a member or sub-team wishes to accomplish is already an issue in order to be placed in the GitHub project boards and timelines. Then, a tool can scrape the issue comments to organize and export the notebook into it's final format.</p>
<p>GitHub provides a nice editor and preview window for markdown editing simplifying the process. Additionally, reorganizing the notebook is as easy as tweaking values in the script to reorganize based on project, time, or any other attributes present in the GitHub issue. For pages that do not follow the engineering model, Obsidian could be used to write these pages before joining with the chronological pages.</p>
<p><img src="Assets/Pasted%20image%2020241016105744.png"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong> - This system uses an easy to learn markdown syntax and provides an intuitive editor. GitHub markdown is one of the most popular markdown flavors and has countless tutorials online.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - While markdown supports many of the features needed (code blocks, typeset math, headers, and tables) it is, by design, much more limited than Google Docs or LaTeX.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - GitHub can support projects with thousands members so will be able to handle this team. For the non-chronological entries, the collaboration aspects will be that of whatever markdown editor the team chooses. The biggest downside of this system is that only the person who wrote the entry will be able to edit it (though there are workarounds for this that can be discussed).</li>
<li><strong>Final Output</strong> - Since the entire notebook would be formatted as markdown, the final output is determined by whatever markdown tool used for exporting. While it will be limited by the supported markdown features, it will be consistently formatted as styles are applied to each class of element rather than an ad hoc fashion like Google Docs.</li>

</span></span></code></pre><p>Typst is a markup-based typesetting system typically used for scientific papers. It is meant to be an alternative to LaTeX, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word. It is simpler than LaTeX since its syntax is just markup, and more complex than Docs and Word by allowing functionality for formulas, precise formatting, and code.</p>
<p><img src="Assets/Pasted%20image%2020241016110843.png"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong> - Compared to LaTeX, Typst is a much simpler and easy-to-understand software since it uses markup, which many team members already know. For those who don't know, it is very simple to pick up. The code and math modes are a bit more complex and would take some time to learn. Another improvement from LaTeX is real-time compilation. This means that changes can be viewed as the document is edited rather than requiring a compile to view changes. One downside to usability is that, similarly to Overleaf LaTeX, entries would all be written in the same document, meaning that the longer the notebook gets, the more difficult it would be to find specific entries or proofread entries.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - Typst is a very flexible software. It has options for math and code modes, which allow scripting and different symbols to be displayed. While formatting is very precise and flexible, a lot of it would need to be scripted.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - Typst supports collaborative features such as comments, change tracking, version history, and Git integration. The overall collaboration is very high as it does support live updates. This will allow team members to work on the same document simultaneously without worrying about overriding each others' work.</li>
<li><strong>Final Output</strong> - The final output of a Typst document is very similar to a LaTeX document. It would be very professionally formatted and easy to follow. Similar to LaTeX, Typst supports an automated table of contents that would update as entries are added.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Typst is a very powerful and flexible tool, it would still have a learning curve for the more complex tools. It would also be inconvenient to have all entries in the same document instead of splitting them up for ease of editing and searching. However, its collaboration and overall usability are much stronger than what was used previously.</p>

<td>Using the decision matrix results combined with our trying out each software to see which would best suit our needs, we decided that <strong>Obsidian would be the best solution</strong>. While it isn't the most collaborative, it is collaborative enough for our needs and should be a great improvement from last year.</td>

            <p>In previous years, our team has used Google Sheets for our task management. This was effective since it was entirely customizable to what we needed.</p>
<p><img src="Assets/Pasted%20image%2020241021190325.png"></p>
<p>This season, we switched to GitHub projects as our task management software. The biggest upgrade from Google Sheets is having multiple views for the same task board. The views can be easily filtered, sorted, and searched through.</p>

<p>Using GitHub allows for in-depth customization by assigning members to tasks, creating multiple labels, defining deadlines and priorities, and adding detailed descriptions and comments.</p>

<p>We plan to keep the project board updated with all tasks (steps in any design cycle) and major deadlines.</p>
