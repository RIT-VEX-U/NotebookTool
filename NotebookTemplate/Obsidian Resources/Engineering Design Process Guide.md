Most of this notebook is written as entries that follow the engineering design process

# Parts
-  Identify the Problem- Why are we doing these requirements / things by which things are judged 
- Brainstorm - Option to pursue - how it fits the requirements
- Build and Program - every meeting if anything at all happened, what changed
- Test Solution - test things
- Select Best Solution - Taking into account properties by construction / testing which option is best/ do we need to think more  - do we need to change requirements



Ordering of entries (not linear):
