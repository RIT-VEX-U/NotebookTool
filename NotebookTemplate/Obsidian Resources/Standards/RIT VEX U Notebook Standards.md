# :LiWholeWord: Conventions & Wording
## :LiTimerReset: Write in Past Tense
All entries should be written in past tense **unless discussing future plans.**
## 💬 Addressing The Team
We should be speaking on behalf of the team's progression as a whole and not on an individual basis. 

To avoid the clunkiness of "RIT VEX U" and "the team" the team should be addressed as **"We" and "Our"**
### Team Name & VEX U
- Our team number is **`RIT`**, and our team name is RIT Tigers. 
- The competition should be addressed as "VEX U". (as written, all caps.)


# :LiArrowUpWideNarrow: Formatting Rules
## :LiArchiveX: Don't use H1.
H1, or a single `# `, is reserved for formatting the titles of notebook entries. You won't need to enter this manually.
## :LiHighlighter: No highlighting.
Consider [[RIT VEX U Notebook Standards#LiBold Bold important things.|bolding]] instead. This change exists to ensure consistent formatting style throughout notebook.

## :LiBold: Bold important things.
**Don't excessively bold.** Bolding should draw the eye to a sentence or important big idea, not yell at the reader.

## :LiBookMarked: Referencing the Game Manual.
Game Manual references must be done in a callout. 

> [!manual] \<SG3\> *Vertical expansion is limited*
> Once the *Match* begins, *Robots* may expand vertically, but may never be “breaking the plane” of more than two *Robots* of the *Ladder* at any given time. For the purposes of this rule, the *Floor* is considered a *Level*.
### :LiBookText: Lengthy manual references disrupt the flow of the notebook.
*In many scenarios, you don't need to reference an entire rule. If the only relevant part of SG2 is section "b", shorten it down.*
#### Bad:
>[!manual]- \<SG2\>: Horizontal expansion is limited.
> Once the *Match* begins, *Robots* may expand beyond the 18” x 18” starting size, within the following criteria: 
> a. *Robots* may never exceed an overall footprint of 24” x 18”. For reference, 24” is roughly the width of a foam field tile.  
> b. From the *Robot’s* perspective, they may only expand in one “X/Y” direction (i.e., from a single “side” of the *Robot*). This “side” must be identified and measured during *Robot* inspection. See the figures below.  
> c. Vertical expansion is addressed separately by rule \<SG3\>. *Robots* may expand both horizontally and vertically; the top of the *Robot* is not considered a “side” in the context of this rule.  
#### :LiMessageSquareHeart: Good:
>[!manual]- \<SG2b\>: Horizontal expansion is limited.
> From the *Robot’s* perspective, they may only expand in one “X/Y” direction (i.e., from a single “side” of the *Robot*). This “side” must be identified and measured during *Robot* inspection.\

The judges don't need to see the entire rule, only what's relevant about it.
## :LiUnlink: No links.
Do not include links. Even if we submit it digitally, judges are not allowed to click links. Instead, clearly refer to sources in text.

**Instead of:**
> According to https://help.obsidian.md/Home,

**Do:**
>According to the Home page on the Obsidian Help site,
## :LiFootprints: No footnotes
Once again, they can't click links.


# Entry Structure
First, let's break down with 
### → Pointer
The pointer sentence outlines the objective of what's going on. *What's the point of the entry?* Here are a few examples of what should come after that "objectives"  
### Content
The first sentence should overview what the *content* of the entry is about.

---
### Example
→ **Objective:** Discuss/review/iterate/review an idea. 
**Bolded thesis-like pointer sentence.** Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, and all the rest of your yapping.

**Bolded summary sentence that concludes/summarizes observations/future plans.**

# Authoring
