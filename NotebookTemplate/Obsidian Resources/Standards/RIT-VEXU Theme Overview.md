# :LiPaintbrush: Colors
Colors will be inspired from RIT's [branding guidelines](https://www.rit.edu/brandportal/). I'm thinking a mix of white, orange, and magenta/pink-ish to give it a bit of pop.
## :LiSwatchBook: Palette
It's best to keep colors consistent. My goal is to make this theme/the notebook to follow a consistent set of colors. We can add secondary colors afterwards.

>[!palette-orange] RIT Orange
>**Hex**: `#F76902`
>**RGB:** `247` `105` `2`

>[!palette-white] White
>**Hex**: `#FFFFFF`
>**RGB:** `255` `255` `255`

>[!palette-magenta] Pantone 2665 C
>*subject to change*
>**Hex**: `#7D55C7`
>**RGB:** `125` `85` `199`



This palette is accessible via root CSS variables that are set in the theme:
```css
var(--brand-orange)
var(--brand-white)
var(--brand-magenta)
```
All color variables yield hex colors.

# :LiTextCursor: Text
Headers use the font family **Univa Nova**.
